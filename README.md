# Capstone_Backend

I installed dotenv, express, mongodb, mongoose, cors, jsx-view-engine, and JWT 
I've created a users collection for my api. In my users folder I have my components folder, which holds something i may not use. I have a controllers folder that holds my routes, a mongoDB conection folder, models and views folders. my pages is in view but  my GET and POST routes are not working properly yet. Have to take a break for now!
GET routes is wroking for flavord and toppings
POST route working for flavors
Still trying to get POST and GET routes to work
I am done with the backend! I had to use x-www-form-urlencoded to POST user to my mongo database. Everything is connecting properly to the backend!
